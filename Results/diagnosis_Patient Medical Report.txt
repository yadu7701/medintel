### Final Diagnosis:

Your patient is a high-risk individual for coronary artery disease due to his age and medical history. The cardiologist recommends further evaluation, and the psychologist mentions that this patient is suitable for coronary angiography. However, no mention of mental health symptoms was mentioned in either report. I suggest we prioritize this patient's cardiac condition based on the current information provided, but keep a watchful eye for any potential psychological symptoms. This patient should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management to ensure adequate care is provided. [Brief summary of findings: high-risk individual for coronary artery disease due to age and medical history, suitable candidate for coronary angiography; no mention of mental health symptoms.]
