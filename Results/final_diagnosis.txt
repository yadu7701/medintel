### Final Diagnosis:

The patient could potentially have multiple health issues. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests might be required to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. An anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder, is a possibility, but it's also possible that he has an underlying cardiac condition, such as atrial fibrillation or coronary artery disease, given his chest pain and shortness of breath. The next steps would involve consulting with cardiology for further evaluation, possibly including diagnostic tests. (Source: Questions from the Medical Case Report.)
